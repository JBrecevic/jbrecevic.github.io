		<p><em>About Me</em></p>
		<p>
			Over the past decade, I have had the privilege
			of working with some of the most interesting companies in the world.
			<br>
			I try to connect with people to uncover
			and understand objections - which helps me align people,
			teams and businesses to execute quickly and precisely.
			<br>
			<br>
			In short, I help give decision makers information that gives them the confidence to act.
